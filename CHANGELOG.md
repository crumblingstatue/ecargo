## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Readme viewer: View the readmes of your dependencies, if they exist locally.

  It can also be used to view changelogs.

### Changed

- In the main view, the link containing the source folder location was removed in favor of a
  folder button that shows the location when hovered, and opens it when clicked.

- The folder icon in the sidebar now opens the source folder of the package, instead of
  focusing the package in the main view.

  There is an additional eye icon now which focuses the package in the main view.

### Fixed

- crates.io theme: Make selected text more legible (higher color contrast)
